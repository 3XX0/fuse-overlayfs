* fuse-overlayfs-1.1.0

- use openat2(2) when available.
- accept "ro" as mount option.
- fix set mtime for a symlink.
- fix some issues reported by static analysis.
- fix potential infinite loop on a short read.
- fix creating a directory if the destination already exists in the upper layer.

* fuse-overlayfs-1.0.0

- fix portability issue to 32 bits archs.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.8

- report correctly the number of links for a directory also for subsequent stat calls.
- stop looking up the ino in the lower layers if the file could not be opened.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.7

- make sure the destination is deleted before doing a rename(2).  It prevents a left
  over directory to cause delete to fail with EEXIST.
- honor --debug.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.6

- do not look in lower layers for the ino if there is no origin xattr set.
- attempt to use the file path if the operation on the fd fails with ENXIO.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.5

- do not expose internal xattrs through listxattr and getxattr.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.4

- fix fallocate for deleted files.
- ignore O_DIRECT.  It causes issues with libfuse not using an aligned buffer, causing
  write(2) to fail with EINVAL.
- on copyup, do not copy the opaque xattr.
- fix a wrong lookup for whiteout files, that could happen on a double unlink.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.3

- fix build with -fno-common
- fix possible segmentation fault in direct_fsync()
- use the data store to create missing whiteouts.
- after a rename, force a directory reload.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.2

- drop special handling for security.capability.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7.1

- fix an issue where a whiteout in the parent directory could hide
  files in the sub directories.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.7

- plugins support.  It allows to read the lower layers from a different data source.
- support running without an upper layer in read only mode.
- honor opaque whiteouts.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.5

- stat reports correctly the number of links for a directory.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.4

- do not lose the setuid bit after a write when the writeback cache is used.
- skip creating a whiteout if the node is present only on the upper layer.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.3

- correctly delete an existing whiteout when the file is recreated (regression introduced with 0.5).
- fix ioctl on directories.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.2

- avoid ino lookup if not necessary.
- include st_dev in the hash key.  Now the same inode number can be safely used by lower
  directories on different file systems.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6.1

- fix a regression introduced with 0.6 where UNIX sockets could not be correctly created.

* fuse-overlayfs-0.6

- fix an issue where changes to an inode would not be visible from another hard link.
  The issue was always present but was made easier to reproduce with fuse-overlayfs 0.5
  that enables FUSE writeback by default.
